# Software
## Firmware v1.1.0
* Store/Load projects from Micro SD card

## Firmware v1.0.0
* 16 step sequencer
* 6 instrument tracks
* 16 patterns per track
* 2 pots for parameter control
* parameter locks: all instrument parameters can be recorded for each step
* different pattern length for each instrument track
* internal clock / midi sync / trigger input (PCB rev 1.3 needed for trigger input)
* swing

# Hardware
## PCB rev 1.4
* changed some of the throughhole resistors to smd parts, so that there is space for labeling function buttons on the PCB
